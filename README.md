# Backtest-Backtrader

I Performed backtest using the backtrader library by making the indicators like Buy, Sell, Higher High Price Channel, Lower Low Price Channel.

- When the Price goes to Higher High Price Channel then Buy Executed & When the Price goes to Lower Low Price Channel then Sell Executed .

- High and Low are defined indicators. They chart the highest/lowest values of the previous 5 bars(Including Current bar).

- Indicators value output in CSV(Indicator.csv)
